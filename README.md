# QuickStart-MVC-6-with-Angular-2
The new ASP.NET Core 1.0 is about to be released and so is the great Angular 2 framework. This is just my own adaptation of the Angular 2 Quick Start (rc1) running in Core 1.0 with Web API (rc2)

##Commands used:+1:

###Typings
To setup typings and the coresponding setting in the typings.json file:
> typings install dt~core-js --global --save


###Build
Execute npm install which in turn calls typings install

###Gulp Task 
"load:scripts" will clear the wwroot\$scripts folder and reload with the external scripts.


###Should remove this later
